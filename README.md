#Crime Analysis in the UK
Crimes involving the use of guns account for around 0.4 per cent of all recorded crimes in England and Wales and have doubled since the mid to late 1990s with the global trade in illicit drugs taken an annual turnover worth billions of pounds. This increase has come against a backdrop of increasingly restrictive laws and increasingly sophisticated public policy measures. Cannabis, which is the most widely consumed illicit drug in England, and shocking guns killings have raised considerable public concern. Police, politicians and media reports have described the emergence of these vice, particularly in some inner-city areas of England as ‘chaotic’ and has far-reaching political, cultural and economic repercussions, adversely affecting prison populations, levels of gun crime, social exclusion and public health and community safety. The UK has a higher proportion of drug and gun crime among the adult population than any of its European neighbours. These consequences and impacts are felt disproportionately by the urban poor and minority ethnic groups. Relatively little, however, is known about criminal attitudes towards and trafficking in illegal drugs and guns, restraining policy developments, policing practices, and understanding the impact of legislation.
